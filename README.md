## Overview

I started this project to better automate the smoking process of our families sausage. I also decided to share the process on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jwmeidinger/detail/recent-activity/shares/) which you will be able to see some pictures of the process below. The project took about 6-7 weeks during my free time through out the day. All of the 3D printed files I used are in the folder as well as the Arduino code.

## Supplies

The following items are what I used in the project but feel free to substitute what ever you want.

- [Elegoo Mega Arduino Kit](https://www.amazon.com/EL-KIT-008-Project-Complete-Ultimate-TUTORIAL/dp/B01EWNUUUA/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=arduino+kit+mega&qid=1594332180&sr=8-3).
- [20KG Servo Motor](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B073F92G2S/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). This is needed as its too hard for the servo in the kit to turn the valve.
- [Power for servo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B013UJAZY8/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1). I used this and cut off the end but you could use a power supply.
- [3D Printer](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/official-creality-ender-3-3d-printer).
- Smoker. My grandpa built ours.
- Sodering iron.
- [2 Meat probes](https://www.amazon.com/Weber-iGrill-Pro-Meat-Probe/dp/B01M8LG8U5/ref=sr_1_18?crid=2D2HI0JIUIPH2&dchild=1&keywords=meat+probes&qid=1594333426&sprefix=meat+pro%2Caps%2C190&sr=8-18) which you can buy at the store or online and if you want to have the jack you can take a meat thermometer apart or just buy a jack online.
- Small 2mm crews to screw the motherboard into the bottom piece of the enclosure.
- Bolt and nut for the servo motor mount.
- Ball valve. I would advise going to a propane/natural gas professional so you don't get any leaks.


## Journey

Update: 1
Current phase: R&D

Here is a photo of the messy bread board(white rectangle). Currently checking out the the meat thermometer probe. I took it off a store bought one with a soldering iron. Temperature is a little slow due to not using step function but should work for our case. Also in the image is a step motor (left of the blue Arduino) which I will be ordering a stronger one in order to increase or decrease the heat (propane).

The next thing I want to do is get my 3D printer to make an enclosure. I also have a spare LED screen that I could hook up to give updates and remaining time for the meat. I might also get another meat probe or modify the other thermistor I have for the temperature of smoker and have the other for meat temp.

Update: 2

Waiting for parts

Update: 3
Current phase: R&D

This weeks update we have a everything setup up ready to be soldered together and put into the 3D box I made. I still need to find a ball valve for natural gas to hook the motor up to and depending on the valve I might need a bigger servo motor due to the lack of power it has. I need to find another meat probe or take the thermometer I have now and add heat resistant wires to it in order to put it in the smoker. With all that being said the electrical schematics and software are complete (besides the resistors and motor tuning).

Update: 4
Current phase: Alpha

We are getting closer and closer to a finished product. From last update I was able to get a valve and a servo which you can see below with the new modified 3D mount. Last item I will probably buy is another probe. After that I should be able to connect everything and put into the printed box. In order to test how much the valve should be open and closed to regulate the heat will take a little bit of trial and error but I might get a Ham or something for testing that.
